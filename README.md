Analysis-on-traffic-flow-data
This repository contains an analysis of traffic flow data, accompanied by a dashboard created using the input provided in Columns A to N of the traffic flow assessment sheet. The designated formulas have been applied to generate the output displayed in Columns O to T.

Step 1: Generating Output
In Step 1, the provided input data in Columns A to N is processed using predefined formulas to compute various metrics related to traffic flow. These metrics are then populated in Columns O to T to provide insights into the traffic conditions.

Step 2: Dashboard Creation
Step 2 involves the creation of a dashboard that links directly to the fields from the Traffic Flow Assessment sheet. This dashboard offers an intuitive interface to visualize the analyzed traffic flow data, enabling users to easily interpret and understand the insights derived from the dataset.

Step 3: Descriptive Analysis
Upon analyzing the input fields, several key insights have been gathered regarding traffic patterns and flow. These insights include:

Peak Hours: Identification of peak hours based on traffic volume.
Congestion Points: Detection of areas prone to congestion or traffic jams.
Trends Over Time: Analysis of traffic patterns and any discernible trends over different time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
Seasonal Variations: Exploration of any seasonal variations in traffic flow, considering factors such as weather conditions, holidays, or special events.
Correlation Analysis: Investigation into potential correlations between traffic flow and external factors like weather, road conditions, or events.
How to Use
Input Data: Ensure that the traffic flow assessment sheet is populated with the relevant data in Columns A to N.
Formula Application: The designated formulas will automatically generate the output in Columns O to T based on the provided input.
Dashboard Access: Access the dashboard created to visualize and interact with the traffic flow analysis results.
Interpretation: Utilize the dashboard and descriptive analysis to gain insights into traffic patterns, peak hours, congestion points, and other relevant factors influencing traffic flow.
